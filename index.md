*Don’t worry about this too much. It’s a C++ adjacent code structure.*<br>

`dHjpc21|Z2|zdhVz  `→ Trismegitus → Father of Alchemy<br>
`cHJpbmNpcGx|      `→ Principle  → Could refer to the principles of alchemy<br>
`d29tYg==          `→ Womb → Most likely refers to creation or transformation possibly the [alembic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alembic)<br>

## Main Menu Circuit
Likely to be unrelated to the lore but still nice to have.<br>

Putting a skull on its colored altar makes the symbol on the skull glow and the altar fills with mercury/sulphur.<br>
Putting a torch on the salt altar fills it with salt if it does something (P-1 entrance, the Moon torch in 4-2, generator room altar with the starting torch).<br>

## The Lion Eating the Sun Statue

This is a reference to the alchemical imagery of aqua regia, a green lion attacking the sun. Where the lion is the aqua regia attacking/consuming the sun which is gold (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suns_in_alchemy)<br>


## 4-3
4-3 seems to be an alchemical facility. It contains piles of magnesium spread around the level.<br>
Outside the Tomb of Kings are piles of gold.<br>
The black material in the green/red torches is referred to as charcoal in the textures.<br>
The blue material that gives off a teal fire is referred to in the textures as Copper Sulfate (Also known as Blue Vitriol, Roman Vitriol, Vitriol of Copper, Bluestone or Chalcanthum/Chalcanth/Calcanthum during the times).<br>
It heats up a crucible full of magnesium, which sparks and releases teal fumes that go into vents.<br>
We do not know the exact reaction going on yet, but it could be referring to the Green Lion eating the sun, purifying matter.<br>
We also have the generator room, which contains... well, giant generators, full of salt and salt skulls.<br>
The generators are changed by what's put on the pedestal. They glow green and spin slowly with a torch, blue/red and spin fast with a blue/red skull.<br>
The generators glowing green can also be found in the background in 4-S.<br>
Alternatively, you can look at it from an elemental perspective. <br>
Piles of metal are stored, there is a water system being piped, in the final arena huge vents move a colorless gas and throughout the level you light fires.<br>
